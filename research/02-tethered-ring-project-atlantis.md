# Tethered Ring — Project Atlantis

- Philip Swan's "Brief Explanation of the Tethered Ring"

## Core Concept (differs from classic orbital ring!)
- Pipeline formed into a ring ~diameter of Earth's moon
- Stays aloft via inertial forces (spinning maglev rings) + tensile forces (tethers)
- Tethered to planet surface using strong lightweight industrial fiber
- **Much lower altitude**: 32 km (stratosphere, not LEO!)
- Supports space launch, transportation, and human settlement
- Achievable with circa-2017 technology

## Key Parameters
- **Circumference**: 32,000 km (encircling Pacific Rim)
- **Altitude**: 32 km above ocean surface
- **Redundancy**: 4 rings total
- **Total construction length**: ~128,000 km
- **Shuttle size**: ~10m wide × 50m long
- **Launch acceleration**: 30 min to near-orbital velocity
- **Target velocity**: Mach 17 (5,800 m/s)
- **Fuel for final orbit insertion**: <1/5 shuttle mass
- **Intercontinental speed**: Mach 3
- **Population capacity**: 250,000

## Construction Process
1. Extrude ring segments into ocean (~1 km/hr)
2. Connect segment ends on ship surface
3. Submerge near seafloor for testing
4. Moor to seafloor with anchors
5. Raise moors to surface
6. Attach tensioning cables to seafloor
7. Spin up maglev ring over several hours
8. Ring rises to equilibrium at 32 km

## Key Differences from Classic Orbital Ring
| Feature | Orbital Ring | Tethered Ring |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Altitude | 300-600 km | 32 km |
| Environment | Vacuum/LEO | Stratosphere |
| Velocity | 8-10 km/s | Sub-orbital |
| Tether length | 300-600 km | 32 km |
| Weather effects | None | YES — critical |
| Materials | Exotic needed | Current tech |

## Engineering Challenges for Simulation
1. **Weather interaction at 32 km**: jet streams, stratospheric winds, temperature
2. **Ocean anchoring**: seafloor mooring, cable tension management
3. **Maglev dynamics**: spin-up process, magnetic field management
4. **Structural integrity**: turbulent sea conditions during construction
5. **Origami/deployment**: unfolding from ocean to stratosphere
6. **Tether catenary**: cable shape under gravity + wind + thermal loads
7. **Marine construction**: extrusion, assembly, submersion cycle
